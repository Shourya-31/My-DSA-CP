// Backtracking approach to solve N-Queens problem
// Concept: Retrace steps when a solution path does not lead to a valid solution

// Types:
// 1.Decision based backtracking: YES/NO decisions at each step
// 2.Optimization based backtracking: Finding the best solution among all possible solutions
// 3.Enumeration based backtracking: Generating all possible solutions
