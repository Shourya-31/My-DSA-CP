// Optimization for Linear Time Complexity
// Problem: Count the number of ways to reach from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of an m x n grid, moving only down or right.
// Approach: Use combinatorial mathematics to calculate the number of unique paths.
// So Total Ways = (n-1 + m-1)! / (n-1)! * (m-1)!
