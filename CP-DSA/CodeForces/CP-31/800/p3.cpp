// A. Cover in Water
// time limit per test1 second
// memory limit per test256 megabytes
// Filip has a row of cells, some of which are blocked, and some are empty. He wants all empty cells to have water in them. He has two actions at his disposal:

// 1
//  — place water in an empty cell.
// 2
//  — remove water from a cell and place it in any other empty cell.
// If at some moment cell i
//  (2≤i≤n−1
// ) is empty and both cells i−1
//  and i+1
//  contains water, then it becomes filled with water.

// Find the minimum number of times he needs to perform action 1
//  in order to fill all empty cells with water.

// Note that you don't need to minimize the use of action 2
// . Note that blocked cells neither contain water nor can Filip place water in them.

// Input
// Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t
//  (1≤t≤100
// ). The description of the test cases follows.

// The first line of each test case contains a single integer n
//  (1≤n≤100
// ) — the number of cells.

// The next line contains a string s
//  of length n
// . The i
// -th character of s
//  is '.' if the cell i
//  is empty and '#' if cell i
//  is blocked.

// Output
// For each test case, output a single number — the minimal amount of actions 1
//  needed to fill all empty cells with water.

// Example
// InputCopy
// 5
// 3
// ...
// 7
// ##....#
// 7
// ..#.#..
// 4
// ####
// 10
// #...#..#.#
// OutputCopy
// 2
// 2
// 5
// 0
// 2

// Note
// Test Case 1

// In the first test case, Filip can put water in cells 1 and 3. As cell 2 is between 2 cells with water, it gets filled with water too.

// Test Case 2

// In the second case, he can put water sources in cells 3 and 5. That results in cell 4 getting filled with water. Then he will remove water from cell 5 and place it into cell 6. As cell 5's neighbors, cell 4 and cell 6, have water in them, cell 5 also gets filled with water. You can see the illustration of this case below.
